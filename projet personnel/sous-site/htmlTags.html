        <h2>What are HTML tags?</h2>
        <p>HTML tags are used to mark up the content of a website. Each HTML tag has a specific purpose and tells the
            browser how to display the content that it contains. For example, the <span
                class="html"></span>&lt;p&gt;</span> tag is used to create a paragraph, the <span
                class="html"></span>&lt;a&gt;</span> tag is used to create a link, and the <span
                class="html"></span>&lt;img&gt;</span> tag is used to add an image to a page.<span
                class="html"></span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
        <p>HTML tags are written in the form of <span class="html"></span>&lt;tagname&gt;</span> for the opening tag and
            <span class="html"></span>&lt;tagname&gt;</span> for the closing tag. The forward slash in the closing tag
            tells the browser that this is the end of the element. The content that you want to mark up goes between the
            opening and closing tags.</p>
        <p>Some HTML tags have attributes, which are additional pieces of information that provide additional details
            about the element. For example, the <span class="html"></span>&lt;a&gt;</span> tag can have an `href`
            attribute that specifies the URL of the link, and the <span class="html"></span>&lt;img&gt;</span> tag can
            have a `src` attribute that specifies the source of the image. Attributes are written in the form of
            `attributename="attributevalue"` inside the opening tag of the element.</p>

        <h2>How do I use HTML tags?</h2>
        <p>To use HTML tags, you will need to write them in your HTML code. Each HTML tag has an opening and closing
            tag, and the content that you want to mark up goes between these tags. For example, to create a paragraph,
            you would write <span class="html"></span>&lt;p&gt;</span> at the beginning of the paragraph and <span
                class="html"></span>&lt;/p&gt;</span> at the end of the paragraph. The forward slash in the closing tag
            tells the browser that this is the end of the element.</p>
        <p>If the HTML tag has attributes, you can add them inside the opening tag of the element.For example, to create
            a link to the W3C website, you could write the following code:</p>
        <span class="html"></span>&lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;W3C website&lt;/a&gt;</span>
        <p>This code will create a link with the text "W3C website" that takes the user to the W3C website when clicked.
            The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the link, and the content between the opening and closing <span
                class="html"></span>&lt;a&gt;</span> tags specifies the text of the link.</p>
        <h2>What are some common HTML tags?</h2>
        <p>There are many different HTML tags that you can use to create a website. Some of the most common ones
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;p&gt;: for creating a paragraph</li>
            <li>&lt;a&gt;: for creating a link</li>
            <li>&lt;img&gt;: for adding an image</li>
            <li>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;: for creating headings</li>
            <li>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;: for creating unordered and ordered lists</li>
            <li>&lt;div&gt;: for grouping content together</li>
            <li>&lt;form&gt;: for creating a form for user input</li>
        </ul>
