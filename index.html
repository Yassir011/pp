      <h1>HTML: The Language of the Web</h1>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating
        web pages and applications. It allows web developers to structure the
        content and layout of a website, and to add multimedia and interactive
        elements.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started with HTML</h2>
      <p>
        To start using HTML, you will need a text editor to write your code.
        Some popular text editors for HTML include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notepad (Windows)</li>
        <li>TextEdit (macOS)</li>
        <li>Sublime Text (Windows, macOS, Linux)</li>
        <li>Atom (Windows, macOS, Linux)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have a text editor, you can create a new HTML file. Then, you
        can start writing your HTML code using the basic structure shown below:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        <span class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
        <span class="html">&lt;html&gt;</span>
          <span class="html">&lt;head&gt;</span>
            <span class="html">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="string">My Website</span><span class="html">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
          <span class="html">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
          <span class="html">&lt;body&gt;</span>
            <span class="html">&lt;h1&gt;</span><span class="string">Hello, world!</span><span class="html">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
          <span class="html">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
        <span class="html">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        In this code, we use the
        <span class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration to specify
        that this is an HTML5 document. The
        <span class="html">&lt;html&gt;</span> element contains the entire
        website, and inside it we have a
        <span class="html">&lt;head&gt;</span> element and a
        <span class="html">&lt;body&gt;</span> element. The
        <span class="html">&lt;head&gt;</span> element is where we put
        information about the website that is not displayed on the page, such as
        the title of the website. The
        <span class="html">&lt;body&gt;</span> element is where we put the
        content of the website that will be displayed on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can add more elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and
        links, to add more content and structure to your website. Once you have
        written your HTML code, save it as a .html file and then open it in a
        web browser to view your website. You can then continue to edit and
        update your HTML code to add more features and functionality to your
        website.
      </p>
      <h2>How do I view my HTML code in a web browser?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have written your HTML code, you can save it with a .html file
        extension and then open it in a web browser to view your website. This
        will allow you to see how your HTML code is translated into a website,
        and to make sure that everything is working as it should.
      </p>

      <h2>Where can I learn more about HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        To learn more about HTML and how to use it to create a website, you can
        visit the
        <span class="link"
          ><a href="https://www.w3.org/html/">W3C HTML website</a></span
        >
        or search for online tutorials and resources. There are also many books
        and courses available that can teach you more about HTML and web
        development.
